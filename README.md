# wine-or-cheese

A very early version of a game engine written with [allegro](http://liballeg.org/)

## What is it?

This is an example game written in C++ with [allegro](http://liballeg.org/) in an expandable game engine style. Right now it only consists on a menu screen, but it will be expanded upon in the future. 

## How is it compiled?

So far this has been completly written and compiled on linux and has not been tested with any other operating systems, but it has been written in a way that it should cross compile without any difficulty. 

* The first step in to install the allegro libraries, this can be done following [this guide](https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Install_Allegro5_From_Git/Linux/Debian)
* After that all that needs to be done is to run the make file included in the project
